## Creative Coding Year 4 - Portfolio of Work

This site is a portfolio of the work I have completed so far in the Creative Coding module. Here you will find various p5.js sketches, and some explanations of the process involved in creating them. These sketches can also be viewed on CodePen.io.


### Introduction/Exercise 01

This was an introduction to the Creative Coding module. It uses HSB colour mode instead of RGB. It uses stepX, stepY, gridX and gridY variables to display squares of varying hue, saturation, and brightness.

### Colour & Shape - Exercise 02

This is the first exercise that was completed after the introduction. The width and height of the squares/rectangles can be adjusted using the mouse. This was done by using mouseX and mouseY variables.
