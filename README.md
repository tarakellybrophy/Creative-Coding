## Creative Coding Year 4 - Portfolio of Work

This site is a portfolio of the work I have completed so far in the Creative Coding module. Here you will find various p5.js sketches, and some explanations of the process involved in creating them.


### Introduction

This was an introduction to the Creative Coding module. It uses HSB colour mode instead of RGB. The size and amount of squares/rectangles can be adjusted using the mouse position on the canvas.
