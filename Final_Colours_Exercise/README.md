### Creative Coding Libraries
---

Completely re-did the whole exercise to make it more creative. Instead of an interactive colour wheel, I instead chose to create a canvas the user could draw on with rainbow colours. This idea was partially based on a helpful tutorial by Kelly Lougheed on Medium.com. https://medium.com/@kellylougheed/rainbow-paintbrush-in-p5-js-e452d5540b25
